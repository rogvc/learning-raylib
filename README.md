# Learning raylib (C# bindings)

I've always wanted to build simple games using raylib, and I love C#, so I decided to combine both passions and create this repository.

Here you will find a directory where I recreated a bunch of the examples from the [raylib website](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) using the great [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs) library. I've tried to make the C# code look as close as possible to its C equivalent, so I hope you find this useful as you're learning raylib on your own as well.

See the [examples](./examples) directory to get started!
