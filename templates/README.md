# Raylib-cs Templates

Use these templates if you want to create a new raylib project using c# and dotnet.

To install the template:

```pwsh
# from project root
cd templates/basic-template
dotnet new --install ./
```

To create a new project from the template:

```pwsh
dotnet new raylibstarter
```

In the future, I plan on improving these templates, turning them into a template package, and then uploading it to NuGet.
